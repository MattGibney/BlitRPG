# BlitRPG

## What is this?
This is an intentionally ambitious project aimed to help push myself to learn game dev. This is *not* an attempt to build a game and there is no gaurantee that half of the features outlined below will ever get made. That being said, I would very much like to see that completion eventually, even if it's something that I do on-and-off over the new few years.

I've already started working on some of the concepts outlined below and have uploaded a couple of videos to Youtube to demonstrate. The code used to show this working is hacked into a copy of the 32Blit project itself and so is not suitable to be shared at this time. I intend to pull the code out into *this* repository and continue development from there.

## Goals
Create a some-what modular library of features, It should, in theory, be possible to add and remove features with little effort. There will be a number of core features that will exist inside of the core. I'll do my best to keep all other features outside and in stand-alone modules. Please note that the following lists are subject to change

Core Features:
- [ ] Tile based maps
- [ ] Animated player movement
- [ ] Mobs
- [ ] Mele and Sword based combat
- [ ] Player Health (and death)

Modular Features:
- [ ] Fishing
- [ ] Mining
- [ ] Smithing
- [ ] Crafting
- [ ] Magic (skills and combat)

## 32Blit
I am building this mostly to play around with my beta unit of the 32Blit. This That does not mean that this is strictly a project for the Blit, however it is the only device that I will be supporting or testing on. I encourage you to follow along with the 32Blit project and when they become available to purchase, I encourage you to buy one. It's a neat device.

## Dependancy Management
At this moment in time, i'm not really sure what is the best way to manage dependancies within the C++ eco system. With that in mind, I am currently intending to pull in dependancies using GIT sub modules, it will allow for easy control over the version of external code used and is very easy to manage.

## Author
I'm a professional programmer with experience in quite a few high level languages. Most recently i've been spending a lot of time in the Javascript world. I'm very new to C++ and as a result, there will be a lot of situations where I make mistakes. I am very open to help and guidance. If you spot an issue with my code, or feel that you could do a much better job. I encourage you to raise a pull request to let me know! Please :)
