# Creating Maps
This guide covers the process of creating a new Map within the BlitRPG 
environment. If you encounter any issues while following this guide, please do
raise an issue on GitHub and i'll do my best to respond quickly.

## Requirements
* Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org)
* Tilesheet image, no larger than 128px x 128px

## Before we begin

### What this guide isn't
This is not a guide on how to use the Tiled editor, there are plenty of those
available to find on the internet. They will do a much better job of that than I
ever could

### About the tilesheet
Here we are limited somewhat by the capabilities on the 32Blit. It's possible
that things will change in the future, for now however all spritesheets are
divided into 8x8 pixel sections. If you want to use larger sprites, you will
need to use multiple sprites at once, we'll cover this in more detail later.
